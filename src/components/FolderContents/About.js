            I've found myself in the world of performing arts since I was young, 
            and in front of a computer since I was younger. I've always had an affinity for problem-solving and creativity,
            and using software to craft what I am imagining, has always been a passion of mine.

            I've worn the hats of a developer, filmmaker, photographer, customer service representative, 
            & teacher. Although the context varies, the essence of what drives me has been the same: 
            creating things that are an extension of me and that others can enjoy and/or benefit from.

            I am currently volunteering with Code Nation and working at Nebula Academy as an Associate Teacher & Software Engineer
            where I am hoping I can make an impact teaching Software Engineering to 
            students who are from underrepresented & underserved populations, like myself, to get ready for a career in tech.
